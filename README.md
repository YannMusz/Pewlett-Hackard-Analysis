# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
Employee Database using SQL

## Purpose: 
1. Create and use database in SQL.
2. Import CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
3. Create tables on PG admin
## Overview: 

Due to the concern of a silver tsunami where a great number of employees were retiring creating a great number of empty jobs, we were tasked to create SQL queries to generate the list of retiring employees and other that qualified for mentorship

## Results: 

1. Retiring Counts by Title for a total of 90,398 potential retirees.

2. Mentor Eligibility List of 1549 employees born in 1965.

## Summary: 
We can see that the silver tsunami will have a massive impact, leaving 90,398 vacancies.  

### 2. Are there enough qualified employees in the departments to mentor the next crop of employees?

While narrowing the  criteria down we find out that the potential mentee list is 1,549 employees and hence shows a significant gap between the vancancies and qualified mentors

## Future Reference:
To help our narrow the gap for the mentoring program, the list of 90,000 employees was narrowed down by setting the age criteria to 35 at the start of their existing job which resulted in 5521 that could be matched with the 1549 mentees.
